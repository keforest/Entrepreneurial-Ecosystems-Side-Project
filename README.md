# Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Side Project

## Introduction

What is an entrepreneurial ecosystem? This is a question that scholars and business-owners alike are trying to answer. Loosely defined, an entrepreneurial ecosystem tends to act like an ecosystem you might find in nature, where interdependent actors indirectly or directly rely on one another for survival, creation, and growth. Interest in the definition of an entrepreneurial ecosystem has significantly increased over the past few years. The bounds for an ecosystem have been qualitatively defined, but the need for a more quantitative approach has risen. Working alongside Dr. Evan Johnson at UNC Chapel Hill, I have attempted to capture the complexity of these relationships utilizing machine learning algorithms.  

Although this research continues to be an ongoing project, preliminary results have been promising. Utilizing a hierarchical clustering algorithm, there are currently ten different ecosystem clusters identified. Each of the clusters has identified firms that are related to one another through parameters such as, but not limited to, owner ethnicity, veteran type, organization structure, FEMA region, website ownership, and population size. Eventually, this project will look at how these ecosystems interact with one another through a network analysis. 

Additionally, there has been interest in looking at pre-existing ecosystems that exist just through geographic proximity. An additional analysis was done looking at Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and how differences in government funding has changed throughout the pandemic.

## Data 

For the ecosystem analysis, a sample of data from the System for Award Management (SAM) was used, obtained in June 2021. This sample has 167 columns and over 72,000 rows. Additionally, descriptions were imported from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). This dataset contained three columns (NAICS code, title of industry, and industry desciption) and over 2,000 rows.

For the MSA-level analysis, additional data was obtained from SAM, broken down by MSAs.
